h2. bashreduce : mapreduce in a bash script

bashreduce lets you apply your favorite unix tools in a mapreduce fashion across multiple machines/cores.  There's no installation, administration, or distributed filesystem.  You'll need:

* "br":http://github.com/erikfrey/bashreduce/blob/master/br somewhere handy in your path
* gnu core utils on each machine: sort, awk, grep
* netcat on each machine

h2. Configuration

If you wish, you may edit @/etc/br.hosts@ and enter the machines you wish to use as workers.  You can also specify this at runtime using @br -m "host1 host2 host3..."@

To take advantage of multiple cores, repeat the host name as many times as you wish.

h2. Examples

h3. sorting

<pre>br < input > output</pre>

h3. word count

<pre>br -r "uniq -c" < input > output</pre>

h3. count words that begin with 'b'

<pre>br -r "grep ^b | uniq -c" < input > output</pre>
